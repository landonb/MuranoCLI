Log into Murano.

If you are having trouble logging in, try deleting the saved password first:

  murano password delete <username>

You might also need to unset the password environment variable:

  MURANO_PASSWORD=

You can also try the logout command:

  murano logout
  ).strip

  c.example %(
    Login interactively. You'll be asked for your username (email) and password.
  ).strip, %(murano login)

  c.example %(
    Or, specify the account to use to logon.
  ).strip, %(murano login <username>)

  c.example %(
    If you want to include the password, use an environment variable.
  ).strip, %(MURANO_PASSWORD=xyz murano login <username>)

    Developers can specify a different host than might be configured globally.
  ).strip, %(murano login <username> --host <address>)

# - User might be wanting to use :env or :specified and avoid creating/editing project config

# hrmmmmm... i think this could work...

# and what about, say, murano solution create in empty directory,
#   i think that works: we would have to maybe save to :project file there, too...

Log out of Murano.

This command will unset the user.name in the user config, and
it will remove that user's password from the password file.

Essentially, this command is the same as:

  murano password delete <username>
  murano password delete <username>/twofactor

Include the --user option to also clear the username, e.g.,

  murano config --unset user.name --user
  murano config --unset user.name --project
  ).strip

  c.project_not_required = true

  c.option '--token', 'Remove only the two-factor token'
# FIXME: What if user specified another config?
#   --configfile :specified / MURANO_CONFIGFILE :env / and :project and :user
  c.option '--username', 'Also remove the user.name config values'

  c.action do |args, options|
    c.verify_arg_count!(args)
    MrMurano::Account.instance.logout(options.token)
